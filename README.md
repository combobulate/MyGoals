# MyGoals

A custom goal tracker application.

I have a problem. I have goals of all sizes, and so I wind up creating many To Do lists, where each list is of similarly-sized goals: one list is for the three quick things I need to do this morning and can't just do while writing the list, another is for things to do this week where each thing might take a few hours or more, another is for projects in progress, another is for skills to learn, and so on. One of the biggest separators between lists is usually the amount the goal can be broken down to smaller goals, and often the small goals are parts of the bigger goals. Really, what I wanted was one application where I could track all of my goals on any scale, and could easily add new subgoals, exhaustively.

Seemed like a good excuse to work on one of my goals, learning Windows Forms with C#.

# Current state of the project:
* I can add goals, and children of goals!
* There's a bunch of blank space to fill with other content
* There's some spoof data loaded automatically

# To do list for this to do app:
* Add ability to mark goals complete
* Add ability to toggle viewing completed goals
* Add toggles to minimize all/maximize selected and children
* Add save/load functionality
* Add time tracking
* Add search function for partial string match
* Make it look less ugly
* and more!
